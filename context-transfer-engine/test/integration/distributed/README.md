# Distributed CTE Unit Tests

This directory contains configuration for running Content Transfer Engine (CTE) unit tests in a distributed 4-node containerized environment.

## Architecture

- **4 Docker containers** representing 4 distributed nodes
- **4 storage targets** - one HDD per node (node1_hdd1, node2_hdd2, node3_hdd3, node4_hdd4)
- **Shared network** - 172.26.0.0/16 subnet for inter-node communication
- **Node 1** - Primary node that builds CTE, launches the runtime, creates CTE, and runs tests
- **Nodes 2-4** - Secondary nodes that wait for build completion, then start their runtimes

## Files

- `docker compose.yaml` - Docker Compose configuration for 4-node cluster
- `cte_config.yaml` - CTE configuration defining 4 storage targets
- `hostfile` - List of hostnames for distributed runtime
- `run_tests.sh` - Automated test runner script (recommended)
- `README.md` - This file

## Prerequisites

1. Docker and Docker Compose installed
2. IOWarp runtime dependencies image available: `iowarp/clio-core:latest`
3. Spack environment with `iowarp-runtime` package
4. At least 64GB RAM available for containers (16GB per node)

## Usage

### Quick Start (Recommended)

Use the automated test runner script:

```bash
# Navigate to the distributed test directory
cd test/unit/distributed

# Run ALL tests with automatic setup and cleanup
./run_tests.sh

# Run specific tests by filter
./run_tests.sh -t "PutBlob"
./run_tests.sh "GetBlob*"
./run_tests.sh "*neighborhood*"

# Run tests and keep containers for debugging
./run_tests.sh --keep

# Run filtered tests and keep containers
./run_tests.sh --keep -t "distributed"

# Show full logs after tests
./run_tests.sh --logs

# See all options
./run_tests.sh --help
```

The script automatically:
1. Checks prerequisites
2. Cleans up any previous test runs
3. Starts all 4 nodes
4. Monitors test execution
5. Displays results
6. Cleans up containers (unless `--keep` is used)

### Test Filtering

The distributed test runner supports filtering tests using Catch2 patterns:

```bash
# Run all tests (default)
./run_tests.sh

# Run tests matching exact name
./run_tests.sh -t "PutBlob Basic Test"

# Run tests with wildcard patterns
./run_tests.sh "PutBlob*"           # All tests starting with "PutBlob"
./run_tests.sh "*neighborhood*"     # All tests containing "neighborhood"

# Run multiple test patterns
./run_tests.sh "PutBlob,GetBlob"    # Tests matching either pattern

# Run tests with specific tags
./run_tests.sh "[core]"             # Run tests tagged with [core]
./run_tests.sh "~[slow]"            # Exclude slow tests

# Combine filter with other options
./run_tests.sh --keep -t "distributed"
./run_tests.sh --logs "*neighborhood*"
```

**Note**: By default, if no filter is specified, ALL tests run.

### Test Output Verbosity

Tests are configured with reduced verbosity to keep output clean:
- **Default behavior**: Only shows test failures and info-level logging
- **Success messages**: Individual assertion successes are hidden
- **Failure messages**: All failures are shown with full details
- **Summary**: Test summary always displayed at the end

This makes it easier to spot issues in distributed test runs while still seeing all CTE info logs.

### Runtime Initialization Control

The `test_core_functionality` executable uses the `CHI_WITH_RUNTIME` environment variable to control whether the Chimaera runtime should be initialized:

- **Default (unset)**: Runtime is initialized by the test executable (standalone mode)
- **CHI_WITH_RUNTIME=0**: Runtime initialization is skipped (distributed mode)
- **CHI_WITH_RUNTIME=1**: Runtime is initialized by the test executable (same as default)

In distributed tests, the runtime is already initialized by `chimaera runtime start` before tests run, so `CHI_WITH_RUNTIME=0` is set in the docker-compose.yaml configuration.

For local standalone testing:
```bash
# Standalone mode (default - runtime initialized by test)
./test_core_functionality

# Distributed mode (runtime must be initialized externally)
export CHI_WITH_RUNTIME=0
./test_core_functionality
```

### Manual Test Execution

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# Navigate to the distributed test directory
cd test/unit/distributed

# Start all 4 nodes
docker compose up

# Or run in detached mode
docker compose up -d
```

### What Happens Automatically

1. **Node 1 (Primary)**:
   - Loads spack environment with `iowarp-runtime`
   - Starts IOWarp runtime
   - Builds Content Transfer Engine
   - Installs CTE binaries to shared volume
   - Creates storage directory `/mnt/hdd1`
   - Waits for all nodes to be ready
   - Runs unit tests (`test_core_functionality`)

2. **Nodes 2-4 (Secondary)**:
   - Wait for binaries to be available in shared volume
   - Load spack environment with `iowarp-runtime`
   - Create storage directories (`/mnt/hdd2`, `/mnt/hdd3`, `/mnt/hdd4`)
   - Start IOWarp runtime
   - Wait for tests to run

### Monitoring Test Execution

```bash
# View logs from all nodes
docker compose logs -f

# View logs from specific node
docker compose logs -f cte-node1

# Check test execution status
docker compose logs cte-node1 | grep -A 20 "Running unit tests"
```

### Executing Commands in Containers

```bash
# Execute command in node 1
docker exec -it cte-distributed-node1 bash

# Execute command in node 2
docker exec -it cte-distributed-node2 bash
```

### Stopping the Environment

```bash
# Stop all containers
docker compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (cleans up storage)
docker compose down -v
```

## Network Configuration

- **Subnet**: 172.26.0.0/16
- **Node 1**: 172.26.0.10 (iowarp-node1)
- **Node 2**: 172.26.0.11 (iowarp-node2)
- **Node 3**: 172.26.0.12 (iowarp-node3)
- **Node 4**: 172.26.0.13 (iowarp-node4)

## Storage Configuration

Each node has its own storage target:

| Node | Target Name | Mount Point | Capacity | Manual Score |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 1    | node1_hdd1  | /mnt/hdd1   | 10GB     | 0.25         |
| 2    | node2_hdd2  | /mnt/hdd2   | 10GB     | 0.25         |
| 3    | node3_hdd3  | /mnt/hdd3   | 10GB     | 0.25         |
| 4    | node4_hdd4  | /mnt/hdd4   | 10GB     | 0.25         |

All targets have equal manual scores (0.25) to ensure balanced data distribution across nodes.

## Volumes

- `cte-install` - Shared install directory for CTE binaries
- `hdd1-storage` - Storage volume for node 1
- `hdd2-storage` - Storage volume for node 2
- `hdd3-storage` - Storage volume for node 3
- `hdd4-storage` - Storage volume for node 4

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

If the build fails on node 1:
```bash
# Check build logs
docker compose logs cte-node1 | grep -i error

# Restart with clean volumes
docker compose down -v
docker compose up
```

### Runtime Connection Issues

If nodes cannot communicate:
```bash
# Check network connectivity
docker exec cte-distributed-node1 ping iowarp-node2
docker exec cte-distributed-node1 ping iowarp-node3
docker exec cte-distributed-node1 ping iowarp-node4

# Verify hostfile is correctly mounted
docker exec cte-distributed-node1 cat /etc/iowarp/hostfile
```

### Test Failures

If tests fail:
```bash
# View detailed test output
docker compose logs cte-node1 | grep -A 100 "Running unit tests"

# Run tests manually
docker exec -it cte-distributed-node1 bash
cd /content-transfer-engine/build-docker
./test/unit/test_core_functionality
```

### Storage Issues

If storage directories are not accessible:
```bash
# Check mounted volumes
docker exec cte-distributed-node1 ls -la /mnt/hdd1
docker exec cte-distributed-node2 ls -la /mnt/hdd2

# Verify permissions
docker exec cte-distributed-node1 touch /mnt/hdd1/test_file
```

## Customization

### Changing Number of Nodes

To add or remove nodes:
1. Update `hostfile` with new node names
2. Add/remove node services in `docker compose.yaml`
3. Update `cte_config.yaml` to add/remove storage targets
4. Adjust network IP addresses accordingly

### Changing Storage Capacity

Edit `cte_config.yaml` and modify the `capacity` field for each device.

### Using Different Storage Types

Edit `cte_config.yaml` and change `media_type` (e.g., "SSD", "NVMe") and adjust `manual_score` accordingly.

## Notes

- The configuration uses the default IOWarp runtime configuration (no custom chimaera config needed)
- All nodes share the same CTE configuration file mounted read-only
- Node 1 is responsible for running the tests
- The test execution is sequential - Node 1 runs tests after ensuring all nodes are ready
- Containers remain running after tests complete to allow inspection (`tail -f /dev/null`)
