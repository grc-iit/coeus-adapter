# Reduce variables in Allocator and simplify Backend

Remove buffer_ and buffer_size_ from Allocator. We will use
accel_data_ and accel_data_size_. We should rename accel_data_ to
just data_ and accel_data_size_ to data_size_. Note that accel_id_
only applies to the data_ pointer, not the md_ pointer.

# MemoryBackend 

Augment the MemoryBackend class to include a variable called ``u64 root_offset_``. This is 0 by default.
This is used to represent the case where the backend is actually apart of a larger existing backend.
This is the case, for example, with sub allocators. Really the only time this should be non-zero.

Make it so MemoryBackendId has two variables:
```
MemoryBackendId {
    u32 major_;
    u32 minor_;
}
```

Major for example could represent pid, minor would be relative to a pid. This is for future use.
For now, assume user hardcodes the backend ids as constants.

# ArrayBackend

Make it so array backend uses malloc for md and sets md_size_ to the ArrayBackendHeader.

The region should be only for the data segment.

Augment ArrayBackend to take as input the offset in the case it is a sub allocator's backend.
It should be an optional parameter by default 0.

# Sub Allocators

I want to introduce the concept of SubAllocators. These are allocators that work in conjunction with the main allocator
for the backend. The OffsetPointer returned by a SubAllocator is always relative to the main backend.

AllocatorId should have the following fields:
```
struct AllocatorId {
    MemoryBackendId backend_id_;  // The backend this is attached to
    u64 sub_id_(0);  // The unique id of allocator on this backend. Main allocator always 0.
};
```

Expose the following method in the BaseAllocator class. Assume the AllocT has things like backend. 
CoreAllocT will inherit from Allocator always:
```
template<typename AllocT, typename ...Args>
AllocT *CreateSubAllocator(u64 sub_id, size_t size, Args&& ...args) {
    ArrayBackend backend;
    FullPtr<char> region = Allocate(size);
    backend.shm_init(region.ptr_, size, region.shm_.GetOffset());
    AllocatorId sub_alloc_id(backend_.id_, sub_id);
    AllocT sub_alloc;
    sub_alloc.shm_init(sub_alloc_id, backend, std::forward<Args>(args)...); 
}

template<typename AllocT>
void FreeSubAllocator(AllocT *alloc) {
    FreeOffset(alloc->backend.md_);
}
```

# Heap

Create a class called heap under context-transport-primitives/include/hermes_shm/memory/allocator. 

This is not an allocator in and of itself, but is a useful helper. 

```
template<bool ATOMIC>
class Heap {
    hipc::opt_atomic<ATOMIC> heap_(0);
    size_t max_size_;

    size_t Allocate(size_t size, size_t align = 8) {
        size = ...; // Align size to align bytes.
        size_t off = heap_.fetch_add(size);
        if (off + size > max_size_) {
            HSHM_THROW_ERROR(...);
        }
        return off;
    }
}
```

# ArenaAllocator

Add to context-transport-primitives/include/hermes_shm/memory/allocator/arena_allocator.h

Just grows upwards. FreeOffset, CreateTls, FreeTls, AlignedAllocate is unimplemented (but not erronous if it gets called).

Templated, takes as input ATOMIC. The arena may or may not be atomic.
* Allocate calls Allocate on the heap.
* The heap is stored in the shared memory header.

```
template<bool ATOMIC>
class ArenaAllocator {}
```

# Make Pointer better
@CLAUDE.md

Remove data_ and data_size_ from allocator. Use only backend.data_ and backend.size_
Backend should also have a function called Shift. 
Shift takes as input:
1. OffsetPointer shift (the offset from the beginning of data)
This will change both the size and offset.

Verify that unit tests still pass after this change.

Let's also make the following changes:
1. OffsetPointer -> OffsetPtr. Make OffsetPtr templated, with default void.
2. Pointer -> ShmPtr. Make ShmPtr templated, with default void.
3. Remove TypedPointer and replace all occurences with ShmPtr
