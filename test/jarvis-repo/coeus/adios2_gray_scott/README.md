Gray-Scott is a 3D 7-Point stencil code

# Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pnorbert/adiosvm
pushd adiosvm/Tutorial/gs-mpiio
mkdir build
pushd build
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j8
export GRAY_SCOTT_PATH=`pwd`
popd
popd
```

# Gray Scott

## 1. Setup Environment

Create the environment variables needed by Gray Scott
```bash
spack load mpi
export PATH="${GRAY_SCOTT_PATH}:$PATH"
```````````

## 1. Create a Resource Graph

If you haven't already, create a resource graph. This only needs to be done
once throughout the lifetime of Jarvis. No need to repeat if you have already
done this for a different pipeline.

If you are running distributed tests, set path to the hostfile you are  using.
```bash
jarvis hostfile set /path/to/hostfile
```

Next, collect the resources from each of those pkgs. Walkthrough will give
a command line tutorial on how to build the hostfile.
```bash
jarvis resource-graph build +walkthrough
```

## 2. Create a Pipeline

The Jarvis pipeline will store all configuration data needed by Gray Scott.

```bash
jarvis pipeline create gray-scott-test
```

## 3. Save Environment

Store the current environment in the pipeline.
```bash
jarvis pipeline env build
```

## 4. Add pkgs to the Pipeline

Create a Jarvis pipeline with Gray Scott
```bash
jarvis pipeline append gray_scott
```

## 5. Run Experiment

Run the experiment
```bash
jarvis pipeline run
```

## 6. Clean Data

Clean data produced by Gray Scott
```bash
jarvis pipeline clean
```

# Gray Scott With Hermes

## 1. Setup Environment

Create the environment variables needed by Hermes + Gray Scott
```bash
# On personal
spack install hermes@master adios2
spack load hermes adios2
# On Ares
module load hermes/master-feow7up adios2/2.9.0-mmkelnu
# export GRAY_SCOTT_PATH=${HOME}/adiosvm/Tutorial/gs-mpiio/build
export PATH="${GRAY_SCOTT_PATH}:$PATH"
```

## 2. Create a Resource Graph

If you haven't already, create a resource graph. This only needs to be done
once throughout the lifetime of Jarvis. No need to repeat if you have already
done this for a different pipeline.

If you are running distributed tests, set path to the hostfile you are  using.
```bash
jarvis hostfile set /path/to/hostfile.txt
```

Next, collect the resources from each of those pkgs. Walkthrough will give
a command line tutorial on how to build the hostfile.
```bash
jarvis resource-graph build +walkthrough
```

## 3. Create a Pipeline

The Jarvis pipeline will store all configuration data needed by Hermes
and Gray Scott.

```bash
jarvis pipeline create gs-hermes
```

## 3. Save Environment

Store the current environment in the pipeline.
```bash
jarvis pipeline env build
```

## 4. Add pkgs to the Pipeline

Create a Jarvis pipeline with Hermes, the Hermes MPI-IO interceptor,
and gray-scott
```bash
jarvis pipeline append hermes --sleep=10 --output_dir=${HOME}/gray-scott
jarvis pipeline append hermes_api +mpi
jarvis pipeline append gray_scott
```

## 5. Run the Experiment

Run the experiment
```bash
jarvis pipeline run
```

## 6. Clean Data

To clean data produced by Hermes + Gray-Scott:
```bash
jarvis pipeline clean
```
