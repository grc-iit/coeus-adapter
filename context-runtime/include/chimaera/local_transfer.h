/**
 * LocalTransfer - Chunked data transfer between worker and client
 *
 * This class encapsulates the streaming transfer protocol for moving
 * serialized task data through FutureShm's copy_space buffer.
 *
 * The transfer protocol uses FUTURE_NEW_DATA flag for synchronization:
 * - Sender sets flag when data is available
 * - Receiver unsets flag when data is consumed
 * - Both sides respect time budgets and can be called multiple times
